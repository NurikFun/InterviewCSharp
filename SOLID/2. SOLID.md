# SOLID

**What do you mean by SOLID Design Principles in C#?**

The SOLID Design principles are the design principles that basically used to manage most of the software design problems that generally we encountered in our day to day programming. These design principles are provided with some mechanism that will make the software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

**What is the main reason behind most of the unsuccessful applications?**
The following are the main reasons for most of the software failure.

1. Putting more functionalities on classes. (In the simple word a lot of functionalities we are putting into the class even though they are not related to the class.)
2. Implementing Tight coupling between the classes. If the classes are dependent on each other, then a change in one class will affect the other classes also.

**How to overcome the unsuccessful application Development problem?**

1. We need to use the correct architecture (i.e. MVC, Layered, 3-tier, MVP, and so on) as per the project requirements.
2. As a developer, we need to follow the Design Principles (i.e. SOLID Principles).
3. Again we need to choose the correct Design Patterns as per the project requirements.

**Introduction to SOLID Design principles in C#**
The SOLID Design principles are basically used to manage most of the software design problems that generally as a developer we face in our day to day programming. SOLID principles represent five design principles that basically used to make the software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

**SOLID Acronym**

1. S stands for the Single Responsibility Principle which is also known as SRP.
2. O stands for the Open-Closed Principle which is also known as OSP.
3. L stands for the Liskov Substitution Principle which is also known as LSP.
4. I stand for the Interface Segregation Principle which is also known as ISP.
5. D stands for Dependency Inversion Principle which is also known as DIP.

**What are the Advantages of using SOLID Design Principles?**
We will get the following advantages of using SOLID Design Principles in C#.

1. Achieve the reduction in complexity of the code
2. Increase readability, extensibility, and maintenance
3. Reduce error and implement Reusability
4. Achieve Better testability
5. Reduce tight coupling
